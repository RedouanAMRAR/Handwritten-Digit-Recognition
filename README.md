# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using PyTorch

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing a neural network using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Features
- Utilizes PyTorch, a leading deep learning library.
- Implements data preprocessing and normalization for the MNIST dataset.
- Includes a neural network model with dropout for regularization.
- Employs various optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and early stopping.
- Experiments with different hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
